ugh you sweats are such **sweats** what the fuck

Anyways, Heya There, I'm Wolfsvi. Or-- You May Recognize Me More As Kittspi / Kitters / Zera(ora). If You Don't Know Me Check Out www.patreon.com/kittspi Real Quick. I Also Might Be Soundin' Like An Entirely Different Person Appart From My Other Github Or Patreon. ...Yeah I Rushed This, But I Kinda Wanted Y'all To Understand How I Usually Would Tone As In Real Life Or In General.

> "Why The **Fuck** Does Kitt(spi) Have A Whole Other Github Tag?"

 ...Good Question.

Answering That, I Made This Alernative To Separate Info About What I Do On Certain Skins. I Have **Most** Of My Originals, (Other Github and Patreon) On Most Of My Pokemon Skins And ONLY Pokemon Skins. But This One's To Resemble The Gamer I Am.

My Weirdling Video Game Interests:

🌙 :Pokemon (UNITE)

🐾 :Fortnite...

🌙 :Splatoon

🐾 :Super Smash Bros.

I'll Be Fr, I'm Indefinitely Betting No One Expected A ***Tomboy Furry*** To Play-- Of All Games-- Fortnite.

Majority Of These Games I Can Play With Little To No Time At All Myself. My Brother Confiscated My Nintendo Switch And I Can't Get The Shit Back.

To Be Honest, Since I'm Insane Enough, I'll Post My Fortnite User Here: Dakota Wolfsvi

I Literally Took 5 Years Just To Link My Shit To My Epic Games Account. I Wasted All Of My Progress On My Nintendo Switch **Only To Restart Over**.

On The Plus Side, I Got The Chapter 4 Season 2 Battle Pass With Highwire In It, So Who Cares.

> 🐾 ***Pokemon (UNITE)*** 🐾

My Phone's Broken And I Messed Up The Linking With My Pokemon Account And UNITE Itself-- It Only Allows One Device To Be Linked. But The Game's Moderators Itself Are Ass Anyways. 

In- game, I Main Zeraora And Zoroark.
