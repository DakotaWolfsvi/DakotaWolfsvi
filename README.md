Anyways, Heya There, I'm Wolfsvi. Or-- You May Recognize Me More As Kittspi / Kitters / Zera(ora). If You Don't Know Me Check Out www.patreon.com/kittspi Real Quick.

You Might Be Wondering: "Why Does Kitt(spi) Have A whole Other Github Tag?" ...Good Question

Answering That, I Made This Alernative To Separate Info About What I Do On Certain Skins. I Have **Most** Of My Originals, (Other Github and Patreon) On Most Of My Pokemon Skins And ONLY Pokemon Skins. But This One's To Resemble The Gamer I Am.

 Video Game Interests:

🌙 Pokemon (UNITE)

🐾 Fortnite...

🌙 Splatoon

🐾 Super Smash Bros.

I'll Be Fr, I'm Indefinitely Betting No One Expected A ***Tomboy Furry*** To Play-- Of All Games-- Fortnite.

I Also Might Be Soundin' Like An Entirely Different Person Appart From My Other Github Or Patreon. ...Yeah I Rushed This, But I Kinda Wanted Y'all To Understand How I Usually Would Tone As In Real Life Or In General.
